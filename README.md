## Game Content Overview

Categories:
- Supreme Court Basics
- Federal Court System
- Constitution & Powers
- Landmark Cases
- Judicial Vocabulary

Each category has five clues (values $100–$500) covering:
- Structure and powers of the judicial branch
- Federal court levels and jurisdiction
- Key constitutional principles (judicial review, checks and balances, Supremacy Clause)
- Landmark Supreme Court cases
- Essential legal and judicial vocabulary

The answer checking is **forgiving**:
- Ignores capitalization and punctuation
- Accepts equivalent numeric forms (e.g., `9` vs. `nine`)
- Allows minor wording differences as long as key terms are present
